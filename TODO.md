# TODO: Feature Flag Service Completion Checklist

This checklist covers major tasks required to complete the Feature Flag Service as designed in this chat.

---

## 1. Core API & Service Implementation

- [ ] Implement REST API endpoints for flag CRUD (`/v1/flags`, etc.)
- [ ] Implement gRPC API for flag service (using generated proto)
- [ ] Implement streaming endpoint for real-time flag updates (gRPC/WebSocket)
- [ ] Wire up config, audit, and RBAC service skeletons

---

## 2. Service Layer

- [x] In-memory `flag.Service` implementation (for development/testing)
- [x] etcd-backed `flag.Service` (see `internal/flag/etcd_service.go`)
- [ ] Implement `config.Service` (etcd-backed)
- [ ] Implement `audit.Service` (PostgreSQL-backed)
- [ ] Implement `rbac.Service` (PostgreSQL-backed)

---

## 3. Persistence Layer

- [ ] Containerize etcd and Postgres (update `docker-compose.yaml`)
- [ ] Add migration scripts for Postgres (audit, RBAC tables)
- [ ] Add proper error handling and retries for DB interactions

---

## 4. Entrypoint & Server

- [x] Provide `cmd/api/main.go` as entrypoint (starts REST & gRPC, handles shutdown)
- [x] Implement `internal/server/server.go` (REST/gRPC wiring)
- [ ] Add middleware for logging, authentication, and request tracing
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown for HTTP and gRPC servers

---

## 5. Logging & Observability

- [x] Shared logger package in `internal/logger/`
- [ ] Integrate request/response logging middleware
- [ ] Add metrics with Prometheus (optional)
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry/Jaeger tracing (optional)

---

## 6. Configuration & Security

- [ ] Environment variable config (document all required vars)
- [ ] JWT authentication middleware for admin endpoints
- [ ] RBAC enforcement in API handlers

---

## 7. Protobuf & OpenAPI

- [ ] Define/complete proto files for `FlagService`, etc.
- [ ] Generate gRPC and REST server/client stubs
- [ ] Provide OpenAPI spec for HTTP API

---

## 8. Documentation

- [x] Architecture and README
- [ ] Usage examples for CLI and API
- [ ] Document environment setup and local development (`docs/`)
- [ ] Example CLI tool or scripts for flag CRUD

---

## 9. Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for service logic (flag, config, audit, rbac)
- [ ] Integration tests for REST/gRPC endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests with Docker Compose

---

## 10. Deployment

- [ ] Dockerfile for API service
- [ ] `docker-compose.yaml` for local stack (API, etcd, Postgres)
- [ ] (Optional) Kubernetes manifests in `deploy/`
- [ ] (Optional) GitHub Actions CI/CD config

---

## 11. Extensibility

- [ ] Design interfaces and wire for easy back-end swapping (etcd, Postgres, Consul, etc.)
- [ ] Add hooks for real-time updates (NATS/Kafka, etc.)

[x] = Implemented in this chat
[ ] = Still needed
